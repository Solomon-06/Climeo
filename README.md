-Weather-driven theme changes that reflect rain, sunshine, snow, and more.

-A post textbox that shifts its style depending on the time of day — morning, afternoon, evening, or night.

-A handy temperature widget displaying your city’s current temperature in real time.

-A fully weather-themed design that keeps the user experience engaging and unique.

Climeo brings together social interaction and nature’s mood, offering users a refreshing way to connect and share based on their environment.
